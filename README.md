# Medibuddy Insurance EDA

## 📋 Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis on **MediBuddy health insurance data** to uncover patterns in customer demographics, lifestyle factors, and claim charges. This project analyzes insurance claims data to identify key drivers of claim amounts and customer segmentation opportunities.

## 🎯 Objective
To perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on health insurance data and discover:
- Key factors influencing claim charges
- Customer demographic patterns
- Lifestyle factors impact on insurance claims
- Data quality and distribution insights

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- **Source:** MediBuddy Health Insurance Dataset
- **Variables:** Customer demographics, lifestyle factors, and claim charges
- **Analysis Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🔍 Key Analysis Areas

### 1. **Demographic Analysis**
   - Age distribution and claim charges correlation
   - Gender-based claim patterns
   - Regional variations in insurance claims

### 2. **Lifestyle Factors Impact**
   - Smoking status correlation with charges
   - BMI (Body Mass Index) analysis
   - Health conditions impact on claims

### 3. **Claim Charges Analysis**
   - Distribution of claim amounts
   - Statistical summary and outliers
   - Cost drivers identification

### 4. **Data Quality Assessment**
   - Missing values detection
   - Data type validation
   - Duplicate records check

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

- **Age Impact:** Claim charges increase significantly with age
- **Smoking Status:** Strong correlation between smoking and claim amounts
- **BMI Factor:** Higher BMI associated with increased insurance claims
- **Data Distribution:** Most variables show non-normal distributions, requiring appropriate statistical methods
